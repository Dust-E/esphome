# ESPHome, Let's build a room sensor, Part 1

In this video we will add the Bluetooth Proxy functionality to our Basic Setup as well as have a discussion around the Bluetooth Low Energy sensors, then add a DHT22 Temperature and Humidity sensor.

## Bill of Materials

- ESP32 development board (Mine is an ESP32S board, but any will do)  
[https://www.robotics.org.za/ESP32-DEV](https://www.robotics.org.za/ESP32-DEV) in South Africa
- A suitable USB cable
- A 10 ÂµF Capacitor (Optional)  
[https://www.robotics.org.za/CAP-10UF-25V](https://www.robotics.org.za/CAP-10UF-25V)
- A breadboard  
[https://www.robotics.org.za/SYB-130](https://www.robotics.org.za/SYB-130)
- Some Breadboard Jumper wires
- U Shape Breadboard Jumper wires (Optional)
- A DHT11 or DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor module (Serial Data), you can use a DHT11 but it will limit the temperature and humidity range and accuracy
